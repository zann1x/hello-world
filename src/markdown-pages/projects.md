## dev

- **[potter](https://github.com/zann1x/Potter)** \
my submission to the first game jam i ever attended, the geta game jam 7. the theme of this game jam was "time is a curse". this is also the first project that is not only a playground project but actually resulted in a complete game made with unreal engine 4. it is a 2d platformer where you have to reach the end point before time runs out. (c++)
