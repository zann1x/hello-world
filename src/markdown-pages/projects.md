    my submission to the first game jam i ever attended, the geta game jam 7; the theme of this game jam was "time is a curse"; it is a 2d platformer where you have to reach the end point before time runs out; this is also the first project that is not only a playground project but actually resulted in a complete game made with unreal engine 4; during a university course, a jenkins continuous integration pipeline and various tests have been added;
