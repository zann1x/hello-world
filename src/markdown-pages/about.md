hi there, i am lukas. i am currently **studying business information systems** while being employed as a **working student** mainly in the area of sap abap development. outside of this i am a passionate software developer in general.

because of this combined with my past in competitive battlefield i kind of fell in love with **game development** and especially game engine development. that is why even though unrelated to my current employment i try to learn the various concepts around it as much as i can in my spare time. therefore most of my personal projects generally revolve around anything in that area.

as you might guess, i also enjoy **gaming** and **esports**. but that should be the case for anyone with a competitive esports background or anyone creating games and the software for it actually.

besides that i am just a guy spending his time on the things he enjoys the most. this means that you can usually spot me at one of the following places: at my computer **working on some side project**, in the gym **working out** or on the golf course **trying to not lose too many golf balls**.
