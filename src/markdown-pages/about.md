hi there, i am lukas. i am currently **studying business information systems** while being employed as a **working student** mainly in the area of sap abap development. due to my past in competitive battlefield i kind of fell in love with **game development** (especially game engine development). that is why even though unrelated to my current employment i try to learn the various concepts around it as much as i can in my spare time. \
besides that i am just a guy spending his time on the things he enjoys the most. this means that you can usually spot me at one of the following four places: at my computer **working on some side project**, in the gym **working out**, on the golf course **trying to not lose too many golf balls** or at some local entrepreneurial networking event listening to great talks and chatting.
