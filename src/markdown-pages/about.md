    <p>hi there, i am lukas;</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    i am currently studying informatics while being employed as a working student in the web development area; outside of this i am a passionate software developer with a love for open source projects, security and low level programming;
    </p>
    <p>
    besides that i am just a guy spending his time on the things he enjoys the most; this means that you can usually spot me at one of the following places: at my computer working on some side project or playing a video game, in the gym working out or on the golf course trying to not lose too many golf balls;
    </p>
    <p>oh, and it seems like i'm an arctic code vault contributor;</p>
