<section>
    <p>hi there, i am lukas;</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    i am currently <strong>studying informatics</strong> while being employed as a working student in the <strong>web development</strong> area at a company in beautiful bavaria, germany; outside of this i am a passionate software developer with a love for open source projects, security and low level programming;
    </p>
    <p>
    because of my past in competitive gaming i kind of fell in love with <strong>game development</strong> and especially game engine development; therefore a lot of my free time goes into learning or programming something in that area; as you might guess, i also enjoy <strong>gaming</strong> and <strong>esports</strong>;
    </p>
    <p>
    besides that i am just a guy spending his time on the things he enjoys the most; this means that you can usually spot me at one of the following places: at my computer <strong>working on some side project</strong>, in the gym <strong>working out</strong> or on the golf course <strong>trying to not lose too many golf balls</strong>;
    </p>
    <p>oh, and it seems like i'm an arctic code vault contributor;</p>
